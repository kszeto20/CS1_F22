To make sure you understand this, show the sequence of calls made by
print(add(5,3))
You may add print statements to show the results.
Building on this idea, now write a recursive function to multiply two non-negative integers
using only the add function weâ€™ve just defined, together with +1, -1 and the equality with 0
test. Call this function mult. Demonstrate the result by multiplying 8 and 3. As a recursive
function mult(8,3), mult can call itself of course.
